## Files description:
* fig5.jl: Generates the plot of Fig. 5. Gives the perturbation amplitude (alpha) such that 70% of the perturbed states converge back to the initial fixed point with respect to the winding number (q), for different random frequencies widths (beta).
	
* ofpa_$n_$q_$beta_$idx.jld: Serialized data generated by drawing a random direction in a 83-dimensional space and perturbation that stable fixed point with winding number q of the Kuramoto model on a cycle of length 83 with random frequences uniformly distributed in [-beta,+beta], in the chosen direction. "load("ofpa_$n_$q_$beta_$idx.jld")" returns a Dictionary with the following keys:
	* alphas_c: maximal perturbation amplitude such that the perturbed state converges back to the initial fixed point following Kramoto simulations.
	* epsilons_n_q: array of the random perturbations. Each column is a direction.i
	* other fields: obsolete.
	
* ofpa.jld: parameters of the simulations. "load("ofpa.jld")" returns a Dictionary with the following keys:
	* qs: possible winding numbers.
	* freqs: array of random frequencies distributions. Each column is a distribution. 
	* fidxs: indices of the different frequencies distributions.
	* widths: widths of distributions for the frequencies. 
	* nbins: obsolete.
	* n: length of the cycle.
