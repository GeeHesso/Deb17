## Files description:
* os_83_###.jld: Serialized data generated by drawing at random initial angles for the Kuramoto model on a cycle of length n=83, identical coupling and identical natural frequencies, and simulating their time evolution using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta solver of LFNS, "RK_solver1". "load("os_83_###.jld") returns a Dictionary with the fields: 
	* n: size of the Kuramoto cycle considered;
	* n_iter: number of initial conditions drawn at random;
	* q_i: array of the winding numbers of the random initial conditions;
	* q_f: array of the final winding numbers of the final conditions after time evolution the corresponding initial conditions.
	
* strogatz_correl.jl: Computes and plots the correlation coefficient between the initial and final winding numbers.
	
* strogatz_plot.jl: Plots the histogram of the initial and final winding numbers together with least square zero-mean gaussian fit.
